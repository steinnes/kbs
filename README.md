## Roots

This interface was originally built by me when I made [`kyber-k8s`](https://github.com/TakumiHQ/kyber-k8s)
which I have since stopped using and maintaining.  After moving to other tools I did miss
the `kb config` interface to easily work with the secrets, so I decided to build this ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
